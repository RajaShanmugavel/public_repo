Instructions to run this project:

1. Create a new MySQL database as 'rajadb'.
	- create database rajadb;		

2. Switch to the database.
	- use database rajadb;

3. Create a new table for storing string state.
	- create table user_string(user_id varchar(50), string_state varchar(250));

4. Add a primary key constraint to it.
	- alter table user_string add constraint primary key(user_id);
	-- The MySQL constraints are set as root / mysql

5. Build and Run the application using Maven
	- mvn clean install && java -jar target\usermgmt-1.0.0.jar

6. Open Chrome browser and access below URL
	- http://localhost:8080/adduser?name=raja
	- This redirects to Spring Security Login page.
	- Enter credentials user / password   (all lowercase)
	- Now it must have created a new user with a blank string state.

7. Now use the 'Advanced REST Client' from Chrome browser (Or any other REST client like Postman, Fiddler, etc)
	- Access below URL 
		http://localhost:8080/chars
		with content-type set as 'application/json'
		and Json body as
		[{"character":"a","amount":10}]
	- Note: Override the Spring security

8. Now, access other REST Urls like below to see response of string state for current user of chrome browser. 		
   URLs:
   - http://localhost:8080/state
   - http://localhost:8080/chars
   - http://localhost:8080/sum
   - http://localhost:8080/chars/a

9. Try the same as specified in step 6 using Firefox browser with URL http://localhost:8080/adduser?name=user2
